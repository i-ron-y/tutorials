# Full-Stack React Tutorial - Yelp Clone

Unmodified version, exactly as the tutorial describes.

Install the required packages directly from the [package.json](https://github.com/fullstackreact/react-yelp-clone/blob/master/package.json) file provided on Fullstack React's [react-yelp-clone](https://github.com/fullstackreact/react-yelp-clone) repo, because a lot of the packages are older versions and the current versions don't work for the tutorial.

## Usage

````
cd react-yelp-clone
npm install
npm start
````

Your app should now be accessible at http://localhost:3000.
